# ArbOS

ArbOS is a trusted "operating system‚Äù at Layer 2 that isolates untrusted contracts from each other, tracks and limits their resource usage, and manages the economic model that collects fees from users to fund the operation of a chain's validators. Much of the work that would otherwise have to be done expensively at Layer 1 is instead by ArbOS, trustlessly performing these functions at the speed and low cost of Layer 2.
