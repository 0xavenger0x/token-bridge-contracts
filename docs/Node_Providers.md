To interact with Arbitrum One and the RinkArby testnet, you can rely on the same popular node providers that you are already using on Ethereum. There are multiple providers that may help you build on Arbitrum, here is a list of a couple of them.

## Alchemy

Alchemy provides endpoints for both Arbitrum One (Mainnet) and Rinkeby testnet. Depending one which network you want to interact with, you can use between the following endpoints and interact with directly in the command line or point your MetaMask RPC endpoints to them.
    
    Arbitrum One: https://arb-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/your-api-key
    RinkArby: https://arb-rinkeby.g.alchemy.com/v2/your-api-key

*Not sure how to create an Alchemy API key?*
To use Alchemy's products, you need an API key to authenticate your requests. For detailed steps of how to create one, see the [Alchemy's Documentation](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/introduction/getting-started#1.create-an-alchemy-key).


## Infura

Infura is a node service provider that provides access to Arbitrum One (Mainnet) and RinkArby testnet. To start interacting with either of these networks, you need to set up an Infura account and create a project. Next, you will be given a ***Project ID*** (for detailed steps, see the [Infura's Documentation](https://blog.infura.io/getting-started-with-infura-28e41844cc89/)). You can now select which endpoint you want to connect to, this could be Arbitrum One, or it could be Rinkeby testnet. Depending on which one you choose, your endpoint URL will look like below. You can use these endpoint URLs to start interacting with Arbitrum.

    Arbitrum One: https://arbitrum-mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR-PROJECT-ID
    RinkArby: https://arbitrum-rinkeby.infura.io/v3/YOUR-PROJECT-ID

## QuickNode

QuickNode supports both Arbitrum One (Mainnet) and Rinkeby testnet and allows users to interact with these chains. For a full guide of how to set up an Arbitrum node on QuickNode, see the [QuickNode's Arbitrum RPC Documentation](https://www.quicknode.com/docs/arbitrum).

## Moralis

Moralis allows Arbitrum users and developers to connect to both Arbitrum One (Mainnet) and Rinkeby testnet. To do so, you need to create an account and choose the node you wish to connect to. You will then be presented with a pair of URLs (Arbitrum Mainnet and Testnet) with which you can interact with directly in the command line or point your MetaMask RPC endpoints to them. For full guide and more explanation, see the [Moralis's Documentation](https://moralis.io/full-guide-how-to-connect-to-arbitrum-nodes/).

## Ankr

Ankr provides access to both Arbitrum One (Mainnet) and Rinkeby Testnet. After creating an Ankr account, you will be presented with a pair of URLs which you can use to connect to any of our networks. For more details, see the [Ankr's Documentation](https://docs.ankr.com/blockchains/arbitrum/develop-on-arbitrum).
